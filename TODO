  * if an item is in multiple slots in a smartshop, only show one entity icon for it #11
    * this should only be relevant when you can't show all 4 slots in a single entity
  * show correct item metadata description in shop display #14
    zua: Update smart shops to show the attributes of the actual animal/pet the user will buy by clicking on that item.
    Currently it shows the attributes (color/speed) of the animal placed on the display cell and that does not change
    based on the next animal to sell.
