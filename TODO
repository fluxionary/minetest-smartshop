  * Shops don't always indicate they have been "used" properly #6
    Suppose a shop sells two items, for 2 different denominations of currency. If item 1 has not been bought, and item 2
    has sold out, the shop will appear to be unused. I possibly fixed this w/ a re-ordering of a couple of conditionals
    in the shop colouring logic, but I haven't tested.
    * possibly fixed? need to test
  * Some items appear as unknown nodes in shops. #7
    E.g. the barrel cacti from desert life
    note: i think i've fixed this; show wielditem entity for nodebox/mesh drawtypes
    * possibly fixed? need to test
  * if an item is in multiple slots in a smartshop, only show one entity icon for it #11
    * this should only be relevant when you can't show all 4 slots in a single entity
  * show correct item metadata description in shop display #14
    zua: Update smart shops to show the attributes of the actual animal/pet the user will buy by clicking on that item.
    Currently it shows the attributes (color/speed) of the animal placed on the display cell and that does not change
    based on the next animal to sell.
  * Add a help button #16
  * allow shared shops #23
